# SARS-nCoV-2 Charts

This is a hobby project for educational use only, do not believe anything that this produces!
Data processing is subject to change without notice at any time, for any reason.

## Charts

These plots use a date-correction method to get true infected cases at a specific date. This is neccessary because
a person entering the record as confirmed was actually infected (and infectious) a few days prior, taking incubation
period and reporting delays into account. For this reason, using confirmed at one day will always underestimate the
true number of infected.

Recovered cases are not consistently reported at all, and there are large differences between countries.
Therefore, recoveries need to be modelled.
First, removed cases (in the [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology)
sense of the word) are estimated from a multi-step probabilistic model based on possible patient histories.
This number is related to the number of confirmed deaths to find recoveries as $recovered = removed - deaths$.
See function `removed_estimate` for details of the model, including parameters.

Active cases are calculated from these values as $active = infected - recovered - deaths$.

The specific constants can be found in [`class V`](https://github.com/martok/corona-charts/blob/master/main.py#L33).


### Global Overview
![Active Cases](countries_active.png)

![Change Per Day](countries_perday.png)

$$\alpha = \sqrt[span]{ \frac{A_t}{A_{t-span}} }, \text{ with } span=4 $$

![Time to Doubling](countries_doubling.png)

$$T_{double} = \frac{\log 2}{\log \alpha(infected)} $$

![Estimated Rt](countries_Rt.png)

$$
    r = \log \alpha \\
    \sigma = 1 / {latent\_period} \\
    \gamma = 1 / {infectious\_period} \\
    R_t = \frac{ r (\frac{r}{\sigma m} + 1)^m  }{ \gamma [1 - (\frac{r}{\gamma n} + 1)^{-n} ] }
$$

Technically, $R_t$ ("the number of people a single carrier directly spreads to during their infectious period") only makes sense
if the rate of infection is constant during the entire infectious period.
This is generally only true during a few days at the start of the epidemic, before a country (or even a large number of
individuals) takes measures to reduce spread - but in this time, the sample size is too small for accurate calculations.
Values also become a bit more reliable once a steady state of constant new infections per day is reached. Once that happens
however, Rt is by definition 1.
Nonetheless, R0 has been estimated between 3.8-8.9 [^Sanche2020], a value which is reproduced fairly well in early stages
of most countries in this plot.

![Trajectory](trajectory.png)

Concept borrows from [Aatish Bhatia & MinutePhysics](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/):
> Plot the new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the past week vs. the total confirmed cases to date.
> When plotted in this way, exponential growth is represented as a straight line that slopes upwards.

![Case Fatality Rate](countries_CFR.png)

Case fatality rates depend extremely on the volume of testing (=number of confirmed light cases that will survive) and
attribution of fatalities. The true global average is probably somewhere between the ones shown here.

### Per-Country Data

Full datasets for selected countries.
As a comparision, `removed_shift` shows a simple date-shift after infection.
Note how `recovered_reported` is generally quite different from the calculated likely value.
